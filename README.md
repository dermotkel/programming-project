The project for the programming for Data Analysis Module - 2018

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the project for the Programming for Data Analysis module. It is divided into nine sections including an introduction and conclusion:

- **Obesity** : The relationship between obesity and income is examined and summary statistics and correlations are deduced.
- **Alcohol Consumption** : Similar statistics are derived for this phenomena, articularly its relation to income.
- **Variables** : The different categorical and numerical variables are discussed.
- **Data** : The data for gender, income level, alcohol consumption, body weight, bmi and salary are created
- **Final Datasets** : The final datasets are created using concat and join.
- **Central Limit Theorem** : CLT is briefly discussed as we will be created normally distributed correlated data.
- **Correlated data** : A correlated dataset is created using numpy random multivariate and a Cholesky function.

I would suggest that you run the notebook from top to bottom in order. If you encounter any problems:

Run the cell immediately above - there may be a return needed from here to run your current cell.
If that fails, go back to the top of the notebook and run the cell which imports numpy and the other required packages.
Finally, you may have to close the notebook, kill jupyter notebook on the command line and restart it.
